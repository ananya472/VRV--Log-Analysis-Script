# VRV-Log-Analysis-Script

This Python script is designed to analyze server log files and extract valuable insights regarding traffic and security. It efficiently counts the number of requests made by each IP address, identifies the most accessed endpoint, and tracks failed login attempts to detect potential suspicious activity. By summarizing these key metrics, the script provides a comprehensive overview of server usage patterns and highlights possible security concerns. The results are neatly organized and saved into a CSV file named as log_analysis_results.csv.
